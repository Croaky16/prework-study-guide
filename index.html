          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>

          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
